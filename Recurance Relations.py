#Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5.

#Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).


rp = 0 #total rabbit pairs

n = 5 # n months; rabbit pairs: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
k = 3 #every pair of rabbits produces 'k' pairs as offspring
